LangChain Integration Repository
Overview
This repository demonstrates how to set up and use LangChain to create a document retrieval and question-answering system. The system integrates multiple document sources, processes them into embeddings, stores them in a vector store, and utilizes Google's Generative AI for querying.

Usage
Define Data Sources: Specify the URLs, PDF paths, and text file paths to load data from.

Load Data: Use the appropriate loaders to load data from the specified sources.

Embed and Store Data: Convert the data into embeddings and store them in a FAISS vector store.

Save and Load Vector Store: Save the vector store locally and load it when needed.

Set Up LLM and QA Chain: Use Google's Generative AI for the question-answering chain.

Run Queries: Execute queries against the system.

Features
Load data from URLs, PDFs, and text files.
Convert data into embeddings using HuggingFace models.
Store and retrieve embeddings using FAISS.
Query the data using Google's Generative AI.
